There are many groups of people your eCommerce store needs to identify properly and ensure that the right things happen for them. These include:
     </p>

<ul>
  <li> Customers (of course!) </li>
      <ul>
      <li> Anonymous customers/end users </li>
      <li> End users with different users getting different tiers of service </li>
      <li> Organizations with Administrators if the customer is a company or an organization of some sort </li>
      <li> Families </li>
      </ul>

  <li> IT staff </li>
  <li> Product Managers who update the catalog </li>
  <li> Business Operations who track the flow of money </li>
  <li> Customer Support </li>
  <li> Partners – perhaps channel partners who may be reselling your goods or services </li>
  <li> Suppliers </li>
</ul>

<p> Each user should only have access to the functionality on the site that is right for them. </p>

<p> You may have more than one site from your company and all of them may want to share the same logins. </p>

<p> Users may have logins in other popular services that they want to reuse – such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Sina, Tencent, Taobao, Alipay, LinkedIn etc and they may want to log in from different operating systems and devices.</p>

<p> Of course, you expect your store to be able to adopt the latest security features including captcha, brute force detection, two factor authentication using SMS, velocity checking, one time passwords.</p>

<p> The identity system needs to be really fast, highly available, backed up over multiple data centers and all of this should scale to match your user base – millions to even billions of users. </p>

<p> Finally, your expectation should be that there is no downtime on upgrades.</p>

<p> Our platform can do all this and more. We use open protocols like Oauth2. We enable fine grained role based access control system so customer can define as many roles as needed with arbitrary fine grained access to APIs and functionality.</p>

<p> Last but not the least, we know how hard it is to migrate from your current identity systems and we have a lot of experience migrating from a variety of legacy identity solutions without downtime. </p>
